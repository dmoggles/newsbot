# Semantic Deduplication - Future Implementation Guide

## Overview

The NewsBot deduplicator now includes placeholders for future semantic deduplication capabilities. This feature will enable detection of duplicate stories that have different headlines or URLs but cover the same news event.

## Current Implementation Status

âœ… **Implemented:**
- Configuration support for semantic deduplication
- Placeholder methods for semantic similarity calculation
- Integration points in the main deduplication workflow
- Comprehensive test coverage for placeholders

ðŸ”„ **Placeholder (Not Yet Implemented):**
- Actual semantic similarity calculation using NLP
- Machine learning model integration
- Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Configuration

In `configs/config.yaml`:

```yaml
deduplication:
  # Enable semantic deduplication using NLP (experimental, not yet implemented)
  enable_semantic: false
  # Similarity threshold for semantic deduplication (0.0-1.0)
  semantic_threshold: 0.8
  # Note: Semantic deduplication requires additional NLP libraries and models
```

## Architecture

### Placeholder Methods

1. **`_calculate_semantic_similarity(story1, story2)`**
   - Returns similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0
   - Currently returns 0.0 (no similarity detected)

2. **`_is_semantically_duplicate(story, existing_stories, threshold)`**
   - Checks if story is semantically similar to existing stories
   - Currently returns `(False, "semantic_deduplication_not_implemented")`

### Integration Points

- Main deduplication loop includes semantic check when `enable_semantic=True`
- Statistics tracking includes `duplicates_by_semantic` counter
- Logging includes semantic deduplication status

## Future Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Semantic Similarity
- Implement TF-IDF cosine similarity for headlines
- Add basic text preprocessing (stemming, stop words)
- Set up configurable similarity thresholds

### Phase 2: Advanced NLP
- Integrate sentence embedding models (e.g., SentenceTransformers)
- Add support for BERT-based similarity
- Implement named entity recognition for better matching

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- Add caching for embedding calculations
- Implement batch processing for efficiency
- Add async support for large datasets

### Phase 4: Machine Learning Enhancement
- Train custom models on news data
- Add topic modeling for contextual similarity
- Implement fuzzy matching for edge cases

## Required Dependencies (Future)

```python
# For basic implementation
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
nltk>=3.7
spacy>=3.4.0

# For advanced NLP
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
transformers>=4.20.0
torch>=1.12.0

# For performance
faiss-cpu>=1.7.0  # or faiss-gpu for GPU acceleration
```

## Testing Strategy

Current tests verify:
- Placeholder methods return expected default values
- Configuration integration works correctly
- No impact on existing deduplication functionality
- Statistics tracking includes semantic metrics

Future tests should cover:
- Actual similarity calculation accuracy
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge cases and error handling
- Memory usage optimization

## Usage Example (Future)

```python
# Enable semantic deduplication
deduplicator = StoryDeduplicator()
deduplicator.load_existing_stories(existing_stories)

# This will work once implemented
unique_stories, stats = deduplicator.deduplicate_stories(
    new_stories, 
    enable_semantic=True
)

print(f"Semantic duplicates removed: {stats['duplicates_by_semantic']}")
```

## Notes

- Semantic deduplication is computationally expensive
- Consider running as background job for large datasets
- May require GPU acceleration for real-time processing
- Should be configurable per deployment environment
